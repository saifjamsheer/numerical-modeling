# Mathematical Modeling of the Thermal Protection Layer of Space Shuttles

Final project for ME20021 Modelling techniques 2 at the University of Bath. The purpose of the project was to predict the characteristics of tiles to be used as part
of a thermal protection layer in a next-generation reusable spacecraft by developing and analyzing mathematical models of the temperature through the thickness of
said layer during the re-entry period.
